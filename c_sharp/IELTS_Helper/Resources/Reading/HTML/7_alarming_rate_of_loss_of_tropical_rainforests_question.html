        7? </p>
    <p> In boxes 1-8 on your answer sheet write:<br> <strong>TRUE</strong>&nbsp; <em>if the statement agrees with the

    <p><strong>1</strong> The plight of the rainforests has largely been ignored by the media.<br> <strong>2</strong>
        Children only accept opinions on rainforests that they encounter in their classrooms.<br> <strong>3</strong> It
        has been suggested that children hold mistaken views about the pure' science that they study at school.<br>
        <strong>4</strong> The fact that children's ideas about science form part of a larger framework of ideas mean
        that it is easier to change them.<br> <strong>5</strong> The study involved asking children a number of yes/no
        questions such as Are there any rainforests in Africa?'<br> <strong>6</strong> Girls are more likely than boys
        to hold mistaken views about the rainforests' destruction.<br> <strong>7</strong> The study reported here
        follows on from a series of studies that have looked at children's understanding of rainforests.<br>
        <strong>8</strong> A second study has been planned to investigate primary school children's ideas about
        rainforests. </p>

                    the rainforests.<br> E&nbsp; Without rainforests some animals would have nowhere to live.<br> F&nbsp;
                    Rainforests are important habitats for a lot of plants.<br> G&nbsp; People are responsible for the
                    loss of the rainforests.<br> H&nbsp; The rainforests are a source of oxygen.<br> I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Rainforests are of consequence for a number of different reasons.<br> J&nbsp;&nbsp; As the
                    rainforests are destroyed, the world gets warmer.<br> K&nbsp; Without rainforests there would not be
