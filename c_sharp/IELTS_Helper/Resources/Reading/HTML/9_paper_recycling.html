    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#008080;">PAPER RECYCLING</span></h2>
    <p><strong>A</strong> Paper is different from other waste produce because it comes from a sustainable resource:
        trees. Unlike the minerals and oil used to make plastics and metals, trees are replaceable. Paper is also
        biodegradable, so it does not pose as much threat to the environment when it is discarded. While 45 out of every
        100 tonnes of wood fibre used to make paper in Australia comes from waste paper, the rest comes directly from
        virgin fibre from forests and plantations. By world standards, this is a good performance since the worldwide
        average is 33 percent waste paper. Governments have encouraged waste paper collection and sorting schemes and at
        the same time, the paper industry has responded by developing new recycling technologies that have paved the way
        for even greater utilization of used fibre. As a result, industry's use of recycled fibres is expected to
        increase at twice the rate of virgin fibre over the coming years. </p>
    <p><strong>B</strong> Already, waste paper constitutes 70% of paper used for packaging and advances in the
        technology required to remove ink from the paper have allowed a higher recycled content in newsprint and writing
        paper. To achieve the benefits of recycling, the community must also contribute. We need to accept a change in
        the quality of paper products; for example, stationery may be less white and of a rougher texture. There also
        needs to support from the community for waste paper collection programs. Not only do we need to make the paper
        available to collectors but it also needs to be separated into different types and sorted from contaminants such
        as staples, paperclips, string and other miscellaneous items. </p>
    <p><strong>C</strong> There are technical limitations to the amount of paper which can be recycled and some paper
        products cannot be collected for re-use. These include paper in the form of books and permanent records,
        photographic paper and paper which is badly contaminated. The four most common sources of paper for recycling
        are factories and retail stores which gather large amounts of packaging material in which goods are delivered,
        also offices which have unwanted business documents and computer output, paper converters and printers and
        lastly households which discard newspapers and packaging material. The paper manufacturer pays a price for the
        paper and may also incur the collection cost. </p>
    <p><strong>D</strong> Once collected, the paper has to be sorted by hand by people trained to recognise various
        types of paper. This is necessary because some types of paper can only be made from particular kinds of recycled
        fibre. The sorted paper then has to be repulped or mixed with water and broken down into its individual fibres.
        This mixture is called stock and may contain a wide variety of contaminating materials, particularly if it is
        made from mixed waste paper which has had little sorting. Various machineries are used to remove other materials
        from the stock. After passing through the repulping process, the fibres from printed waste paper are grey in
        colour because the printing ink has soaked into the individual fibres. This recycled material can only be used
        in products where the grey colour does not matter, such as cardboard boxes but if the grey colour is not
        acceptable, the fibres must be de-inked. This involves adding chemicals such as caustic soda or other alkalis,
        soaps and detergents, water-hardening agents such as calcium chloride, frothing agents and bleaching agents.
        Before the recycled fibres can be made into paper they must be refined or treated in such a way that they bond
        together. </p>
    <p><strong>E</strong> Most paper products must contain some virgin fibre as well as recycled fibres and unlike
        glass, paper cannot be recycled indefinitely. Most paper is down-cycled which means that a product made from
        recycled paper is of an inferior quality to the original paper. Recycling paper is beneficial in that it saves
        some of the energy, labour and capital that go into producing virgin pulp. However, recycling requires the use
        of fossil fuel, a non-renewable energy source, to collect the waste paper from the community and to process it
        to produce new paper. And the recycling process still creates emissions which require treatment before they can
        be disposed of safely. Nevertheless, paper recycling is an important economical and environmental practice but
        one which must be carried out in a rational and viable manner for it to be useful to both industry and the
        community. </p>
