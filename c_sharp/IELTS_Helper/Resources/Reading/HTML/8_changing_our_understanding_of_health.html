        <p style="text-align: left;"><em>The fundamental conditions and resources for health are peace, shelter,
            education, food, a viable income, a stable eco-system, sustainable resources, social justice and equity.
            Improvement in health requires a secure foundation in these basic requirements. (WHO, 1986)</em> .<br> <br>
            It is clear from this statement that the creation of health is about much more than encouraging healthy
            individual behaviours and lifestyles and providing appropriate medical care. Therefore, the creation of
            health must include addressing issues such as poverty, pollution, urbanisation, natural resource depletion,
            social alienation and poor working conditions. The social, economic and environmental contexts which
            contribute to the creation of health do not operate separately or independently of each other. Rather, they
            are interacting and interdependent, and it is the complex interrelationships between them which determine
            the conditions that promote health. A broad socio-ecological view of health suggests that the promotion of
            health must include a strong social, economic and environmental focus.<br> <br> <strong>F</strong><br> At
            the Ottawa Conference in 1986, a charter was developed which outlined new directions for health promotion
            based on the socio-ecological view of health. This charter, known as the Ottawa Charter for Health
            Promotion, remains as the backbone of health action today. In exploring the scope of health promotion it
            states that:</p>

        </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><em>Good health is a major resource for social, economic and personal development
            and an important dimension of quality of life. Political, economic, social, cultural, environmental,
            behavioural and biological factors can all favour health or be harmful to it. (WHO, 1986) .</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"> The Ottawa Charter brings practical meaning and action to this broad notion of
            health promotion. It presents fundamental strategies and approaches in achieving health for all. The overall
            philosophy of health promotion which guides these fundamental strategies and approaches is one of 'enabling
            people to increase control over and to improve their health' (WHO, 1986). </p>
